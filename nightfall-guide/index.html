</p>
<p>Hi everyone, my name is Steven and I would like to present to you my first deck guide and matchup analysis of the Nightfall archetype in Legends of Runeterra. I picked up the game when the Rising Tides expansion hit, and I’ve made Masters this season and the previous season. Before playing LoR, I dabbled in the competitive Magic scene and wrote a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernMagic/comments/droc7b/modern_allin_devoted_druid_primer_and_sideboard/">rather lengthy deck guide</a> on the Devoted Druid archetype in MtG. I’m no stranger to card games.</p>
<p>When Call of the Mountain released, I was attracted to the Nightfall archetype due to its cheap spells, sequencing decisions, and difficulty of play. I had some initial success with it, but I kept losing to other aggro decks. It was frustrating to have minor sequencing mistakes cost me games. I ended up playing easier decks after that, such as Demacia Elites and Shen/Fiora - the latter of which I made it to Masters with. I experimented with other archetypes such as Spider Burn from ManuS, but I kept losing to the Bilgewater decks packing 3 copies of Make it Rain.  About a week and a half ago, I ended up rediscovering this archetype and decided to really put in the work to master it. My guide will be a similar format to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LegendsOfRuneterra/comments/gignwj/50_master_rank_games_of_deep_an_analysis/">ImpetuousPanda&rsquo;s Deep deck analysis</a> from a couple of months ago. I loved his guide and I wanted to make mine in a similar style to his. Enjoy!</p>
<p>Before I go any further I would just like to plug <a href="https://twitter.com/NicMakesPlays?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">NicMakesPlays</a>, who has been putting a lot of work refining this archetype and took this deck to Rank 1 NA as well as top 10 in EU. In particular, his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXentKnG734&amp;t=582s">Nightfall videos</a> really helped me learn how the deck worked. I will be rehashing a fair amount of information he has talked about in his videos in the guide below.</p>

(I also played a little more with the deck after the 50 games and climbed to rank 16 in the NA ladder)</p>
<h1 id="the-decklist">The Decklist:</h1>
<h2 id="0-mana">0 mana</h2>
<p><strong>3x Fading Memories</strong>: C tier - One of the most versatile and difficult to play with cards on this list, Fading Memories provides you with a free way to trigger Nightfall at burst speed; however, it comes with some limitations. For starters, it doesn’t allow you to trigger Nightfall when neither player has followers on board, which may be disruptive to early game sequencing. Fading Memories, similar to Lunari Duskbringer, essentially allows you to create “two” Nightfall triggers. It acts as one initially, and then gives you an Ephemeral follower that you can use to trigger Nightfall in the future. Later in this guide, I’ll provide a list of some high-value followers you can copy with Fading Memories. I like keeping this in my hand against aggro, or when you need Nightfall enablers.</p>
<h2 id="1-mana">1 mana</h2>
<p><strong>3x Lunari Duskbringer</strong>: A tier - The key 1-drop to this deck, it gives you a little bit of board presence early in the game as well as being a Nightfall enabler. In addition, it gives you Duskpetal Dust (a burst-speed Nightfall enabler, and a way for you to convert spell mana into unit mana). This card is so powerful because it gives you two Nightfall enablers, which allows the rest of your deck to function. You generally always want to play this on turn 1 and mulligan for it. Opening hands with this card are much smoother than hands without it.</p>
<p><strong>3x Solari Soldier</strong>: B tier - Another cheap Nightfall enabler and provides a lot of board presence, as many decks can’t deal with a 3/3 early. Specifically, it shines against Gangplank/Miss Fortune aggro, as playing this on defense can allow you to blunt your opponent’s early attacks. I’ll go into how to best maximize this card when talking about how to play the deck. Generally, I will not play this on turn 1 unless I’m playing against a slow deck like Trundle/ASol or Warmother’s, or a fast deck like the aforementioned GP/MF aggro. The utility you get from having this card as a Nightfall enabler outweighs the benefit of playing this card on turn 1.</p>
<p><strong>3x Stygian Onlooker</strong>: B tier - The first Nightfall payoff we will be talking about, Stygian Onlooker is one of the best cards in the deck for pushing damage through. Few early game followers can profitably trade with a 4/1 Fearsome. Due to its cheapness and high power, you will want to be using these to pressure your opponent in the early game as well as force favorable trades in the midgame. One of the best starts this deck can have is a turn 2 Solari Soldier into Stygian Onlooker when you have the attack token, allowing you to push through 7 points of damage early in the game. As good as this card is, however, I often mulligan this card away in the SI/Bilgewater matchups, as they have an easier time killing X/1s with Make it Rain or Vile Feast/Unspeakable Horror.</p>
<h2 id="2-mana">2 mana</h2>
<p><strong>3x Diana</strong>: S tier - Diana is one of the best cards in the deck due to her low cost and ability to manage the board. Nightfall as an archetype generally has very little removal but Diana (and Unspeakable Horror to an extent) act as your way to deal with problematic units. She locks down the early game extremely effectively if your opponent doesn’t have a way to deal with her. It’s trivially easy to level her up, as your deck is built around activating Nightfall. Her leveled up form allows her to dodge most cheap removal such as Mystic Shot and Death’s Hand, as well as letting you easily challenge and kill units with more health. She is also a fantastic combo with Cygnus, allowing you to get in for 10-12 elusive damage if uninterrupted. I almost always keep Diana in my opening hand, as she allows you to get free kills on many early game units.</p>
<p><strong>3x Lunari Shadestalker</strong>: B tier - Another Nightfall payoff, the Shadestalker is excellent for getting in chip damage as well as blocking your opponent’s elusive threats. While solid against all regions, I find that the Shadestalker excels against SI and Bilgewater especially as they often do not have an easy way of getting rid of her. In addition, the Shadestalker is an excellent recipient of Gems created from Mountain Goat, as that will allow you to boost her power and make her into more of a threat. Except in the SI/Bilgewater matchups, I often do not keep her in my opening hand, as I find that other cards are more of a priority when mulliganing (Duskbringer/Soldier/Diana).</p>
<p><strong>3x Mountain Goat</strong>: A tier - The GOAT is back and ready to rumble. Recently buffed in the latest balance patch, this card is insane in this deck since it generates early board presence and will often give you a Gem or two before dying. Gems are very powerful in this deck, because they let you trigger Nightfall (though you will need a unit on board) as well as let you buff followers with keywords on them, such as Lunari Shadestalker and Crescent Guardian. This is a card that I am usually happy to keep in my opening hand and run out on turn 2, due to it creating more Nightfall triggers by itself. It is just a strong unit that doesn’t require setup to be good, unlike your other cards. It is also a fine Nightfall enabler itself in the mid to late game.</p>
<p><strong>3x Unspeakable Horror</strong>: A tier - Your only other removal option besides your champions, Unspeakable Horror does a lot of heavy lifting in this deck. Being able to effectively remove X/1s makes your matchup against the aggro decks so much better. It allows you to remove barriers from the Lee Sin/Zed or Fiora/Shen decks as well as Kegs from the Bilgewater decks. In addition, the card is a natural 2-for-1 that generates additional threats, as all of the Nightfall cards are very powerful with the exception of Duskrider (and even that sometimes isn’t too bad). The only matchup this card doesn’t shine is against control, but even then, a ping that generates some card advantage is pretty good. You can use this to set up favorable Diana attacks, as well.</p>
<p><strong>3x Pale Cascade</strong>: A tier - Probably one of Targon’s best spells coming out of the new expansion. Pale Cascade saves your units from removal, allows your units to make favorable trades, and lets you cycle through your deck with the Nightfall cantrip effect. Pale Cascade is especially good with Crescent Guardian as well as Nocturne and Diana. It allows the Guardian to push through extra damage, as well as letting you counter damage-based removal spells on Diana/Nocturne. A common line of play with this deck is playing one of your more expensive units with 2 spell mana and Pale Cascade up, in case your opponent tries anything weird. I often mulligan this away in my opening hand, as it doesn’t help you develop. This card is much better in the midgame, once you’ve already established some board presence.</p>
<p><strong>3x Stalking Shadows</strong>: S tier - This card is one of the most broken cards in the deck, and one you’re almost always happy to see in most matchups. Stalking Shadows provides an incredible amount of card selection (allowing you to dig in the top 4 cards of your deck) as well as card advantage, all for the bargain price of 2 mana. Usually you will want to use this as a way to draw additional Nightfall payoffs, such as Doombeast or Stygian Onlooker. The card is also a fantastic Nightfall enabler because it’s cheap and is burst speed. A common play to defend yourself from aggro decks, for example, is to Stalking Shadows into a Ephemeral Doombeast to drain 2 and hamper your opponent’s attack. Honestly, I’m surprised this card hasn’t been nerfed to 3 mana yet - it’s that good.</p>
<h2 id="3-mana">3 mana</h2>
<p><strong>3x Crescent Guardian</strong>: B tier - Your primary beatstick, this card is one of your more powerful followers and can push through a lot of damage in the midgame. A 5/3 with overwhelm dodges a lot of removal spells being played right now in the meta (Make it Rain/Death’s Hand/Avalanche) and it’s virtually guaranteed to trade into a 2 or 3 drop and push some extra damage through. This card combines especially well with Pale Cascade, as you can make the Crescent Guardian survive combat as well as push through for a truckload of damage. If you can make this follower survive past the first attack phase, then you are more than happy. I often mulligan this as it’s more clunky and expensive than your other cards.</p>
<p><strong>3x Doombeast</strong>: A tier - While Crescent Guardian is your beatstick, Doombeast is your defensive powerhouse, as well as your most reliable way to close the game. Seriously, the amount of reach this card provides is insane. It’s extremely easy to find two copies of Doombeast with something like Stalking Shadows or cloning this with Fading Memories, and you suddenly have what amounts to be a Decimate in hand. The lifegain is also very relevant when MF/GP Aggro is such a huge part of the meta. The key thing I learned about this follower is that it’s actually quite poor at attacking, since a 3/2 trades with nearly anything on turn 3, BUT it’s a fantastic defensive play to blunt opponent’s attacks. As a 3 power unit, it blocks opposing Fearsome units as well as it trades with a lot of other early game minions and even some champions (like Miss Fortune). Oftentimes your only wincon in the late game will be to set up for some Doombeast drains, so keep this in mind and play to this win condition. I also tend to mulligan this away, as it’s a better mid to late game unit than an early game one.</p>
<h2 id="4-mana">4 mana</h2>
<p><strong>3x Nocturne</strong>: S tier - The other champion in the deck, and your primary win condition in most games. Nocturne can allow you to win unwinnable games by granting all of your allies Fearsome as well as being a terrifying 5/3 or 6/4 fearsome attacker by himself. In addition to this, he is also a great removal option for larger units because he grants an enemy Vulnerable, and he can blunt attacks by virtue of his -1/-0 ability (which is a lot more powerful than it looks). Generally, you want to deploy him as your last unit in hand in order to set up for a big attack. It’s also a good idea to deploy him when your opponent doesn’t have a whole lot of mana left. Timing him is really tricky - I haven’t even figured out how to best optimally play Nocturne - but generally, you want to work towards that big Fearsome attack where you land him and then level him up on attacks.</p>
<h2 id="6-mana">6 mana</h2>
<p><strong>1x Cygnus the Moonstalker</strong>: C tier - Also recently buffed, Cygnus mostly serves as an additional copy of Nocturne in this deck as a way to close out a game. Cygnus can be awkward at times because he is expensive (6 mana) and he generally cannot be played on defense, as you would lose access to his Elusive-granting ability. However, similar to Nocturne, this card can win you games no other card could. It is especially useful against regions that don’t have Elusive units as it can push through 8-13 points of damage, depending on what your other units are. Cygnus synergizes especially well with Diana, as you can often pump Diana up to be a 5 or 7 power unblockable attacker in the late game. The reason why Cygnus isn’t the best is because he is expensive, poor on defense, and he can be fairly easy to interact with in the late game (frostbite, expensive removal spells, elusive blockers). However, I think an additional finisher is sometimes needed to close out games.</p>
<p><strong>Honorable Mentions</strong></p>
<p>Some other tech cards you can consider are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guiding Touch</li>
<li>Lunari Priestess</li>
<li>Spacey Sketcher</li>
<li>Glimpse Beyond</li>
<li>Atrocity</li>
<li>Behold the Infinite</li>
<li>Shroud of Darkness</li>
<li>Bastion</li>
</ul>
<p>After testing this specific list for around ~40 games or so, though, I wouldn’t recommend any changes. I think this current list allows us to play the midrange role effectively and I am also hedging strongly against the various aggro decks on ladder right now. If you wanted to skew a little more towards a control based metagame, then the Invoke cards like Behold or Priestess could be good additions. People were running Atrocity, but I think it makes you a little too all-in and weakens your deck dramatically against aggro. I was running Behold the Infinite over Unspeakable Horror for my first handful of games with this deck, but I found that I needed the ping to make the aggro matchups (as well as Lee Sin) more palatable.</p>
<h1 id="tips-and-tricks">Tips and Tricks</h1>
<h2 id="set-up-for-big-turns">Set up for big turns</h2>
<p>This should be fairly self evident because you’re playing a deck with a lot of Nightfall cards, but instead of curving out like other decks, you need to set up for turns where you can play an enabler plus a payoff or two. Enablers include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lunari Duskbringer/Duskpetal Dust</li>
<li>Solari Soldier</li>
<li>Mountain Goat/Gem</li>
<li>Fading Memories</li>
<li>Stalking Shadows</li>
<li>Any cheap Nightfall card (warning! Do this only as a last resort)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="midrange-not-aggro">Midrange, not Aggro</h2>
<p>The most important thing to keep in mind when playing this deck is that this deck is a midrange deck, not an aggro deck, hence why I’ve been careful to avoid calling this deck “Nightfall Aggro”. This deck assumes an aggressive slant in many matchups, yes, but you often need to become the control deck against, say, Miss Fortune/Gangplank Aggro. This deck, due to its inherent 2 for 1s, can also play a longer game if necessary against various midrange decks. Evaluate who the beatdown is and play accordingly. If you try to play the deck like an aggro deck, you will lose due to misevaluating your role some percentage of the time.</p>
<h2 id="balance-enablers-and-payoffs">Balance enablers and payoffs</h2>
<p>My other important tip is to make sure your hand has a good mix of Nightfall enablers and payoffs, and make sure to plan ahead several turns in advance to ensure that you can enable Nightfall when you want to. For example, if you have a hand with Solari Soldier in it but all other Nightfall cards, probably think twice about playing it out on 1, because then you won’t be able to trigger Nightfall later in the game. Sometimes you will have games where you have a multitude of cheap enablers but no payoffs, and sometimes you will have games where you have all Nightfall cards but no enablers. Avoiding these situations, and having a critical balance of both enablers and payoffs, is the key to success with this deck.</p>
<h2 id="soft-passing">Soft Passing</h2>
<p>One thing that I do all the time with this deck, but don’t see others do often enough, is “soft passing”. This is a trick where you can play a Burst speed spell and pass to your opponent, where they get the chance to play any cards they want. The initiative then passes back to you, where you can choose to either play any cards you want or pass the turn. A good habit to get into when playing this deck is, when starting your turn, play an enabler (like Duskpetal Dust, for example) and then pass. Oftentimes your opponent will pass back to you, but sometimes they will make a mistake and overcommit. The reason why soft passing is good is because:</p>
<ul>
<li>You give your opponent a chance to make the first play, which, if they do, gives you more information to sequence the rest of your turn</li>
<li>You can have your opponent make a mistake and overcommit mana</li>
<li>You have control over ending the turn. This is important because sometimes you will want to punish players who will keep passing to you by developing your units and then ending the turn, thereby wasting their mana</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason why you want to soft pass with this deck is because your main Nightfall payoffs are units, and if you play a unit, you automatically pass priority to your opponent. This means that when you develop with a Nightfall deck, you will always pass priority over to your opponent. By giving them more chances to play their cards while committing little to no mana of your own, you can more easily dictate the pace of the turn. You’ll have your opponent either overcommit their mana, or give you more information on how to sequence your plays.</p>
<h2 id="bank-spell-mana-early-dependent-on-mu">Bank spell mana early (dependent on MU)</h2>
<p>This heavily depends on the texture of your hand and the matchup, but generally I like to pass the early turns to bank spell mana in order to set up for a strong turn 3 or turn 4. This deck loves to have extra spell mana in order to set up big turns.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-fading-memories">How to use Fading Memories</h2>
<p>With Fading Memories, the best targets to copy are usually:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stygian Onlooker (to push through 4 damage)</li>
<li>Lunari Duskbringer (to create more Nightfall triggers if you need them)</li>
<li>Doombeast (to drain an extra 2 health)</li>
<li>Any follower with Challenger (can use it as a removal spell)</li>
<li>Cursed Keeper (to make a free 4/3)</li>
<li>Riptide Rex (this feels so good)</li>
<li>Commander Ledros (you get a Ledros of your own to block their Ledros and cut their nexus health in half)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="diana-positioning">Diana positioning</h2>
<p>A neat trick that you can do sometimes with this deck is play Diana out when her level up condition is at a 3/4 and a Pale Cascade in your hand. This is so that if your opponent tries to remove her with something that deals 3 damage (Noxian Fervor, Grasp of the Undying), you can Pale Cascade her in response and level her up, granting her an additional point of health and making her a X/4. This comes up somewhat often, so pay attention to Diana’s level up condition.</p>
<h1 id="matchup-guide">Matchup Guide</h1>
<p>To conclude this guide, I’ll go over some common matchups you may see while you are laddering with this deck, as well as list cards that are good in each respective matchup. Generally you will want to be developing a lot with this deck and rarely take open attacks, as many of your units gain additional value if developed onto an attack (like Stygian Onlooker/Lunari Shadestalker/Crescent Guardian). This leaves you vulnerable to cards that punish you for trying to develop onto the board (like Arachnoid Sentry/Avalanche/Leona) so keep that in mind.</p>
<p><strong>Lee Sin/Zed Combo - 60% over 5 games (3/5)</strong></p>
<p>Matchup: Even</p>
<p>The current top dog of the format, this matchup is tricky to play because it’s very difficult for you to interact with their Lee Sin combo kill. In addition, they have solid early board presence in the form of Eye of the Dragon and Mountain Goat. Your goal should be to mulligan for a fast start and to try and spread out as quickly as possible, as their deck contains no real removal. Try and save your Unspeakable Horrors for their Mentor of the Stones. You can manage Zed by chump blocking and by using Diana to challenge Zed, but Lee Sin is very problematic for you as they can easily give him barrier and kill off your strongest unit every turn. Try and pressure them early to force them to spend their mana, and work towards a big Nocturne fearsome attack, as most of their units are small. Stygian Onlooker is great in this matchup, as it attacks past all of their blockers and they don’t have X/1 hate.</p>
<p><strong>Swain/Twisted Fate Control - 80% over 5 games (4/1)</strong></p>
<p>Matchup: Favorable</p>
<p>One of the perks to playing this deck is that it has a decent to favorable matchup against all of the flavors of Noxus/Bilgewater running around right now, and Swain/TF is our best matchup compared to the midrange and aggro versions of Noxus/Bilgewater. Lunari Shadestalker and Crescent Guardian are our best cards against this archetype, as their only clean answer to both of these units is Noxian Fervor. Shadestalker attacks past their copies of Zap Sprayfin and the Guardian can attack past their small units for big damage. Stygian Onlooker isn’t great against this deck (as with all the other Bilgewater decks) due to the presence of Make it Rain. Pressure them early and end the game before they can set up their Leviathan/Swain lock. Keep in mind you can use Gems from Mountain Goat to heal your units, to play around Ravenous Flock.</p>
<p><strong>Gangplank/Twisted Fate Midrange - 43% over 7 games (3/4)</strong></p>
<p>Matchup: Slightly unfavorable</p>
<p>This deck is more problematic than Swain/TF control because they do a better job pressuring you early. They also can incorporate the Nab package with cards such as Black Market Merchant and Yordle Grifter, which makes playing around your own cards impossible. Gangplank is also a nightmare for our deck as it becomes very difficult to win if he ever levels up. Like TF/Swain, they still have trouble dealing with Lunari Shadestalker and Crescent Guardian, but the early pressure they put on you makes it harder to leverage those cards effectively. Prioritize Unspeakable Horror as a way to kill their Kegs, and try to set up good trades with Pale Cascade in order to play around Death’s Hand and Noxian Fervor. Remember that you can sometimes set up situations where you can copy their Riptide Rex and ping them with Unspeakable Horror to trigger Plunder.</p>
<p><strong>Gangplank/Miss Fortune Pirate Aggro - 50% over 6 games (3/3)</strong></p>
<p>Matchup: Even to slightly favorable</p>
<p>I thought this matchup was good, but I picked up some losses near the tail end of the 50 game set to this scary deck. The best way to describe the matchup is that both sides have draws that can run each other over. If you have Solari Soldiers into a Diana that can massacre their board, they don’t stand a chance. However, you can fall victim to early pressure from their side, backed up with Miss Fortune or a turn 5 Gangplank/Jack the Winner. My tip for this matchup is to mulligan for all early game units besides Stygian Onlooker and try to play in a way where you can win the board while minimizing early damage taken. You can’t just trade off and expect to win because their turn 5 plays are very strong and can catch you off guard. Unspeakable Horror and Diana are MVPs in this matchup. In addition, you will want to keep Fading Memories, as being an early Nightfall enabler that can generate a blocker on key turns can be important.</p>
<p><strong>Shen/Fiora Midrange - 50% over 2 games (1/1)</strong></p>
<p>Matchup: Slightly favorable</p>
<p>Low sample size but I don’t think this matchup is that bad. You have a strong early game and they don’t have any targets for their Deny besides Unspeakable Horror and Doombeast drains. Save Unspeakable Horror to proc barriers or to kill Fleetfeather Trackers. Remember that they have a lot of Challenger or Strike units to use Fading Memories on (such as Genevieve Elmheart). Be wary of their single copy of Brightsteel Formation though, as it is often very difficult to beat that card if the game drags out long.</p>
<p><strong>Draven/Jinx Discard Aggro - 50% over 4 games (2/2)</strong></p>
<p>Matchup: Slightly unfavorable</p>
<p>The issue with this deck is Draven as well as his champion spell (Whirling Death) is extremely good versus you, and they have Draven’s Biggest Fan to ensure that they see one in most games. The issue with Draven is that his axes can effectively counter your Pale Cascade, and a 3/3 quick attack is hard to this deck to deal with outside of Diana or Nocturne granting him vulnerable. Try to keep their board small to minimize the impact of Crowd Favorite. Aim for setting up a big Nocturne attack, as most of their units are small.</p>
<p><strong>Trundle/ASol Ramp- 66% over 3 games (2/1)</strong></p>
<p>Matchup: Slightly favorable</p>
<p>Against this deck, you’re on a timer to kill them as fast as possible before they reach 8 to 10 mana. Their early game is horrendous, but they have a very impactful catchup play in the form of Avalanche and a great midgame stabilizer in Trundle. I lost my only matchup against this deck because I thought you were supposed to aggressively open attack to play around Avalanche. This caused me to lose, because I couldn’t develop any more units to my attack. My recommendation is to develop, but try and play around Avalanche while doing so. Again, your three health units such as Lunari Shadestalker and Crescent Guardian are great at doing this. Remember their deck can play a lot of healing and Flash Freezes. Ideally you should try and kill them by turn 8 or 9. Their deck is also vulnerable to a Cygnus the Moonstalker, so keep your eye out for that.</p>
<p><strong>Ashe/Sejuani Frostbite Midrange - 50% over 2 games (1/1)</strong></p>
<p>Matchup: Unfavorable</p>
<p>This deck is not very popular anymore due to the Trifarian Assessor nerf, but I just feel compelled to mention it here because I think this is one of Nightfall’s worst matchups. A focus on 5 power units makes Nocturne kills difficult to execute, and Brittle Steel/Flash Freeze absolutely embarasses most of your units. The only time I won this matchup was because I got very lucky with a Cygnus that went uninterrupted. If you get paired against this deck, good luck.</p>
<p><strong>Nightfall Mirror - 100% over 2 games (2/0)</strong></p>
<p>Matchup: Even</p>
<p>Whoever has the last Diana standing wins the game. Mulligan for her as well as other early game units. The games can be quite swingy, so try and maintain board presence while whittling down theirs. Oftentimes the only removal each side will have will be Unspeakable Horror as well as both champions. If you are ahead, try and play around Nocturne leveling up by sandbagging your 3 power units, as this is often the only way the losing player can turn the match around. Try and play around Pale Cascade if your opponent is representing it.</p>
<p>EDIT: New Matchups</p>
<p>I’ve been playing this deck a lot since the new patch and I wanted to go over a couple of new matchups that I’ve tested.</p>
<p><strong>Soraka/Tahm Kench Midrange</strong></p>
<p>Matchup: Favorable</p>
<p>This is one of the new decks from this expansion and is fairly popular on ladder. Luckily, the reason why I love Nightfall so much right now is that Nightfall absolutely crushes Soraka Kench. Star Spring is generally a blank against you because you will win before that card ever comes online, and they have a lot of low power units, which means that Nocturne is a very effective win condition versus them. Despite being a Bilgewater deck, they don’t run Make it Rain, so feel free to play your Stygian Onlookers with reckless abandon. Try to spread the board and pressure them early. Watch out for Boxtopus, as that card can be effective removal against you if they heal it. Do your best to play around Pale Cascade and Astral Protection, and try to save your Pale Cascades to counter Kench’s Acquired Taste. Work towards a Nocturne level up, as that is the easiest way to win.</p>
<p><strong>Warmother’s/Ledros Control</strong></p>
<p>Matchup: Unfavorable</p>
<p>After playing this matchup a fair number of times in high Diamond, I think it is unfavored if your opponent knows what they are doing. Unlike ASol/Trundle Ramp, this deck has a lot of pings as well as Avalanche, so it’s easier for them to stymie your early aggression. Mulligan for Solari Soldiers as well as your other X/3 units (Lunari Shadestalker/Crescent Guardian) to try and play around Avalanche. Use Pale Cascade to play around their damage-based removal, and try to force them to have the exact combination of Avalanche plus a ping to beat you. Remember that you can use Fading Memories on their Ledros to get a Ledros of your own. This is a matchup where I usually play Nocturne out as a 5/3, as they can struggle to kill him and he deals a lot of damage if unblocked. Overall, this is a tricky matchup because they have a lot of tools to stop your aggression as well as a lot of healing. Sometimes their deck won’t have all the answers though - just constantly force them to “have it”.</p>
<p><strong>Scouts Aggro</strong></p>
<p>Matchup: Even</p>
<p>Played this matchup only a couple of times since this deck is on the rise again somewhat. Generally, whoever develops better in the early game will win, as both sides have limited comeback opportunities, but lots of ways to snowball an early advantage. I like to keep Unspeakable Horror to kill Fleetfeather Trackers and remove barriers generated by Brightsteel Protector, but be wary of Ranger’s Resolve. A key interaction in this matchup is to leave up Pale Cascade to punish them for challenging one of your 2/Xs with Laurent Protege. If you can, kill Miss Fortune on sight, as they have an easier time leveling her up with all of the Scout units than MF/GP.  Be wary of Quinn, as the 2/1 she generates does a good job challenging units like Diana. Just whittle down their board and you should come out ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Deep Control</strong></p>
<p>Matchup: Favorable</p>
<p>As much as I love Deep (it’s the deck that I first played when I started Runeterra), I think it’s ultimately a flawed archetype, because it has to balance spending cards tossing as well as ways to control the board. Luckily, Nightfall is set up perfectly to exploit decks like Deep. Try and line up your Dianas to kill their Deadbloom Wanderers, since they really rely on that card to survive against aggro decks. Save your pings to kill Jauli Hunters, and try to kill them around turn 7 or 8. Like all of the other Shadow Isles matchups, your X/2s and X/3s like Mountain Goat and Shadestalker are very strong, since they let you develop without extending into a Withering Wail. Try and kill their Maokai if you can with your champions, as he simultaneously lets the Deep player toss and control the board at the same time. Oftentimes, you can set up a Nocturne attack to win the game, as many of their early units are small and the Sea Monsters are very clunky if they aren’t Deep already.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Nightfall is, in my opinion, one of the most fun and strategic decks in the entire game, with a lot of decisions to make on each given turn. I’ve just written 4.5k words on this deck and I still feel like I have lots to learn with regards to optimal sequencing and mulligans/matchups. If you haven’t played this deck yet, give it a shot! It plays very differently to most LoR decks and all of the wins feel deeply satisfying. It feels like playing the Turbo Dark Depths deck in MtG (Nocturne is your Marit Lage token), where the entire match leads up to one big attack. If you want to have a decent matchup against the Lee Sin/Zed deck as well as clown the TF/Swain players that are running around the ladder right now, then Nightfall is the deck for you.</p>
