      <h1>All-In Devoted Druid Primer and Sideboard Guide</h1>
<p>
  <small class="text-secondary">

  </small>
  
  

</p>
<p>Greetings r/ModernMagic, my name is Steven and I am a student who enjoys playing competitive Magic on the side. I am here to share a primer and sideboard guide on a deck that I have been crushing with recently - Devoted Devastation, or as I like to call it, All-In Druid. I’ve been working on Druid variants for a couple of months now, and after taking Druid to a 7-2 finish at SCG Regionals and placing second at an IQ last weekend (plus a couple of MODO trophies), I believe I&rsquo;ve come up with an optimal 75 that is well positioned to attack the Modern metagame in preparation for the SCG Invitational.</p>
<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/@Prophylaxis/decks/8b129c09-31c7-4c0a-ba39-081c547ee3e6">Decklist link</a></p>
<p><strong>What is the goal of the deck?</strong></p>
<p>The goal of the deck is to assemble the combo of a non summoning-sick Devoted Druid, a Vizier of Remedies, and an infinite mana payoff (Walking Ballista/Shalai, Voice of Plenty/Eladamri’s Call/Finale of Devastation). The combination of Devoted Druid and Vizier of Remedies produces infinite mana, and you spend it all on an infinite mana payoff to win the game. The deck kills on turn 3 extremely consistently and reliably, and you have multiple means of playing through interaction with cards such as Giver of Runes and Postmortem Lunge.</p>
<p><strong>How do you mulligan with the deck?</strong></p>
<p>The most important thing to realize when you’re looking at opening hands with this deck is to remember you’re not a midrange deck - you’re a combo deck that is looking to end the game as quickly as possible. The strengths of Devoted Druid are its consistency and speed - aside from the Okos maindeck, this deck is not built to grind. Thus, as a general heuristic, I like to keep hands that kill my opponent on turn 4 on the play and turn 3 on the draw. I really try to emphasize hands with Druid in them, especially on the draw - it’s rare that I will mulligan a hand with a Druid in it. Do not be afraid to go to 5 or even 4 cards looking for fast kills - this deck takes advantage of the London Mulligan extremely well and it is possible to put together turn 3 kills on even a mull to 4.</p>
<p>Mulliganing is harder with Once Upon a Time in the deck. Generally, I tell myself that Once Upon a Time can be a substitute for a land or a mana dork/Giver, or it can be a copy of Druid/Vizier/Shalai if the situation calls for it. I try not to keep hands that rely on Once Upon a Time being a specific combo piece since it is unreliable, unlike our other tutors.</p>
<p><strong>Why Oko?</strong></p>
<p>Simply put, I think Oko is the best planeswalker ever printed and if he is available to play in your colors, then you should play him. He really is that game-warping, and provides a powerful plan B that dodges most of the hate that is directed at the deck. I think many of our tougher matchups - Jund, Burn, and UW Control - are significantly improved with access to Oko in the maindeck, and this deck is uniquely positioned to get Oko out as early as possible in those matchups with six mana dorks. Generally, I find that the best things to do when Oko is on the field is to generate a threat every other turn (make a food then turn it into an Elk), turn our opponent’s problematic creatures into Elks, or turn our mana dorks into Elks. I don’t think this is the best Oko deck by a large margin (I think that the Urza decks, with access to random trinkets they can turn into hasty Elks, are the best homes for Oko) but I think he is so powerful that it is worth running him, even if he doesn’t mesh well with our combo plan A.</p>
<p>One thing that I have been toying around with is running Eldritch Evolutions in place of Okos and then putting all of the Okos in the sideboard, but that takes up a lot of sideboard space and there are enough interactive decks running around in Modern that I like access to Okos maindeck to steal games versus them.</p>
<p><strong>Why Postmortem Lunge?</strong></p>
<p>This innocuous uncommon from New Phyrexia is insane in this deck and I probably would never register a Druid list without a copy of this card in the near future. In a typical Devoted Druid list (IE, a list without Postmortem Lunges), if your opponent could spend a removal spell to kill your Druid and then deal with whatever plan B you could present, it was often fairly easy for them to win the game. You often had to spend a lot of resources to put another Druid on the battlefield, and the time you would give your opponent would often be enough for them to win the game.</p>
<p>Lunge flips that script. Postmortem Lunge is the best card in your deck once you have a Druid in the graveyard, and enables comboing from an empty board on three lands (you can Lunge back Druid, tap the Druid and a white mana to play Vizier of Remedies, then combo off with a Ballista/Finale in hand). Once a Druid is in your graveyard, you will often only need to topdeck a Lunge to win the game. It is at its most effective against opposing linear decks, where your opponent is hoping that their one-of piece of disruption is enough for them to slow you down and win the game. When you have Lunge in your deck, it is in your best interest to get a Druid in your graveyard as fast as possible. In addition, remember to kill your Druid in response to a Path or Anger of the Gods (mostly relevant if you&rsquo;re playing online; don’t F6). I have used two copies of Postmortem Lunge to bring back both Druid and Vizier to win the game on an empty board; I have used Postmortem Lunge to bring back Shalai to kill a Shadow player at less than 3 life; and I’ve used Lunge to recur Caustic Caterpillar to act as a Naturalize. It’s an incredibly versatile card that allows you to kill your opponent when they least expect it.</p>
<p><strong>Why are you not playing Collected Company and Chord of Calling</strong>?</p>
<p>I love Collected Company, but I think these two cards have been largely outmoded by Finale of Devastation and Eladamri’s Call. The first reason is consistency. There were so many times I was playing the Company version of Druid and I cast Company, needing to hit a Vizier and/or a payoff to win the game, and I completely whiffed. Company is a powerful card, no doubt about it, but it introduces an element of uncertainty that makes the deck less consistent than usual.</p>
<p>The second reason is clunk. Company and Chord cost 4 and 5 mana effectively (Chord costs 5 because it is most frequently grabbing a two-drop), while Company incentives you to put a bunch of mediocre three drops in your deck. Modern has always been a fast format, but right now there are so many decks that try to ignore what you’re doing and just try and kill you. Titanshift consistently kills you on turn 4 or 5. Urza can quickly assemble its combo or lock you out with Pithing Needle or a Cryptic Command/Mystic Sanctuary loop. Burn can easily kill you on turn 4 with no interaction, and Tron can quickly present unwinnable boardstates on turn 4. I think that cutting Chord and Company streamlines the deck and makes it more linear, which is what I think you want to be doing in this current Modern format.</p>
<p>If Modern ever reverts to being more of a grindy format, then I think we could see a return to Company/Chord, but as of right now I like the more streamlined approach to the deck. With eight creature tutors in the deck, it’s trivially easy to kill your opponent if they let you untap with a Druid in play.</p>
<p><strong>Why are you not playing Stoneforge Mystic?</strong></p>
<p>I was playing the Stoneforge Mystic builds of Devoted Druid a couple of months ago when the card got unbanned, and I thought the card was exactly what we needed to beat the fair decks. Sadly, after a couple of mediocre tournament finishes and a lot of testing, I came to realize that SFM is mostly a trap, and should not be played. The problem with SFM is that it’s a dead draw in so many matchups, and it doesn’t even help against the matchups we are weak against (Burn, Shadow). The linear decks of the format laugh at a turn 2 SFM, and Burn gleefully Searing Blazes your turn 2 SFM while you die with a Batterskull in hand. Shadow ignores your 4/4 Batterskull or they bring in their many copies of Kolaghan’s Command (which they are already playing to target Urza) to deal with the equipment. The only matchup where SFM is quite effective are against the control decks, and I think Oko does just as good or an even better job of pressuring the various control decks of the format. With the Modern metagame being quite hostile to artifacts at the moment (because of Urza), I think putting SFM in your deck is a trap.</p>
<p><strong>Tips and Tricks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Always fetch for white sources given the opportunity (for example, if I have a fetchland and a Razorverge Thicket, I will usually fetch for Hallowed Fountain then play the Thicket). One of the weaknesses of this deck compared to older Druid builds is that sometimes you need a lot of white mana to combo off - you will need WWW in order to go Eladamri’s Call into Vizier of Remedies into Shalai with an active Druid in play, for example.</li>
<li>Against some decks, it might be easier to assemble the prison lock of Shalai + an active Giver of Runes, which gives you and all of your permanents virtual hexproof. This is mostly relevant versus Burn and Jund.</li>
<li>Remember that if you have an active Shalai on the battlefield and you turn a creature you control into an Elk with Oko, that Elk will no longer have hexproof, because of LAYERS.</li>
</ul>
<p>#Sideboard Guide</p>
<p><strong>Amulet Titan</strong></p>
<p>Matchup: Favored</p>
<p>-1 Shalai, Voice of Plenty<br>
-2 Postmortem Lunge</p>
<p>+2 Veil of Summer<br>
+1 Knight of Autumn</p>
<p>In this matchup we want to race because they do not run much interaction maindeck (usually limited to Engineered Explosives). Unless they get a lucky double Amulet draw and kill you by turn 2, you are typically faster by a full turn. Similarly to other big mana decks, much of this matchup is mulliganing - keep hands with turn 3 kills/Druid in them. Postboard we want to bring in Veil of Summer because the way they will win is landing a Primeval Titan with Pact of Negation backup, and most of the Titan builds nowadays run 2 copies of Dismember, which Veil conveniently snags. I used to bring in Path in this matchup, but I think Pathing their Titan is ultimately delaying the inevitable as they will fetch another Titan anyways. Oko can come down on turn 2 and Elk their Amulets, which might make their hand dysfunctional. He’s not a great plan in this matchup, but he still slows them down long enough for you to execute your combo. Elking Primeval Titan is real nice.</p>
<p><strong>Burn</strong></p>
<p>Matchup: Even to slightly favored</p>
<p>-4 Postmortem Lunge<br>
-2 Vizier of Remedies<br>
-1 Once Upon a Time<br>
-1 Birds of Paradise</p>
<p>+1 Burrenton Forge-Tender<br>
+1 Caustic Caterpillar<br>
+2 Kor Firewalker<br>
+1 Knight of Autumn<br>
+2 Path to Exile<br>
+1 Oko, Thief of Crowns</p>
<p>Game 1, your plan is to combo them out by a strong Giver/Druid hand or with the assistance of Postmortem Lunge. Lunge is your most important card Game 1 - your opponent will often tap out to kill your Druid in the early turns, allowing you to Lunge it back and combo off. Sometimes if you mull too low and they’re on the play then you have to let them get Game 1. Your Plan B if they’re on a disruption-heavy draw is to somehow assemble the Giver/Shalai lock, but that is often too difficult to assemble and is weak to their creature-heavy draws. Oko is also quite strong in this matchup; just take care to play around Skullcrack when you are cracking your Food. Oko is often worth three burn spells (if you have excess mana lying around, they have to kill Oko and you gain three life from the food he generates).</p>
<p>Postboard this matchup becomes a lot better as they often do not improve much post-board, while we get to bring in all of our Burn hate. We are looking to lock them out with Kor Firewalkers (which we can find consistently with our creature tutors) and Shalai. Lunge gets shaved as our gameplan completely shifts postboard. Firewalker becomes the best card in this matchup as it stabilizes us, gains us life, and becomes a clock once you have stabilized with other creatures.</p>
<p>I think the presence of Lunge in the maindeck and Okos makes us the best Druid deck suited to fighting Burn if you properly respect it in the sideboard.</p>
<p>Tip in this matchup is that avoid taking damage from your lands if possible, and it is often worth it to pay 4 life if they have a Eidolon out to Call for a Firewalker (depends on the boardstate of course, but Firewalker blanks Eidolon and starts to stabilize you).</p>
<p><strong>Mono Red Prowess</strong></p>
<p>Matchup: Slightly unfavored</p>
<p>-1 Postmortem Lunge<br>
-2 Vizier of Remedies<br>
-2 Noble Hierarch</p>
<p>+1 Burrenton Forge-Tender<br>
+2 Kor Firewalker<br>
+2 Path to Exile</p>
<p>Lava Dart is a menace for our deck and it is why I don’t think this matchup is all that great. Game 1 try to prioritize Giver → Druid lines as opposed to playing out mana dorks unless you need to, as Lava Dart easily mops up one toughness creatures. One funny trick that is relevant in this matchup is if your opponent leads on a Soul-Scar Mage, you can play out a naked Vizier of Remedies to turn off all of their Lava Dart effects, as Vizier cancels out the -1/-1 counter granting effect from Soul-Scar Mage (though this is still extremely risky, as one Bolt or Burst Lightning kills the Vizier). Like Burn, they are often constricted on mana in the early turns, so I think a Lunge kill is viable both in the pre and post board games (though watch out for Surgical Extraction postboard). I would prioritize comboing in both the pre and post-board games, as Bedlam Reveler lets them play a long game and Crash Through lets them ignore your Kor Firewalker effects.</p>
<p><strong>Tron</strong></p>
<p>Matchup: Favored</p>
<p>-3 Oko, Thief of Crowns</p>
<p>+2 Collector Ouphe<br>
+1 Knight of Autumn</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have much sideboard space for Tron because we have the best Tron matchup out of all of the various Devoted Druid decks (I guess besides the ones that maindeck Knight of the Reliquary and a land destruction package). Much like Amulet, you have to keep hands that kill on turn 3 in order to win in this matchup. The good thing is that you put a lot of pressure on them to have Tron on turn 3 plus a relevant payoff (Wurmcoil and Thragtusk don&rsquo;t do it), and with Lunge you can beat a lot of their payoffs. Their best way to beat you out G1 is when they go Karn the Great Creator into Pithing Needle, which you actually cannot beat unless you turn the Needle into an Elk. Postboard we bring in Collector Ouphe to disrupt them from having Tron on three and Knight of Autumn to blow up any Needle effects, Oblivion Stone, or a large Ballista.</p>
<p><strong>Grixis Death’s Shadow</strong></p>
<p>Matchup: Unfavored</p>
<p>-1 Birds of Paradise<br>
-1 Noble Hierarch<br>
-2 Once Upon a Time<br>
-2 Postmortem Lunge<br>
-2 Vizier of Remedies</p>
<p>+1 Chameleon Colossus<br>
+4 Veil of Summer<br>
+1 Oko, Thief of Crowns<br>
+2 Path to Exile</p>
<p>This is one of the worst matchups for All-In Druid because they are extremely efficient, and have strong disruption plus a fast clock. G1 is largely dependent on how good their hand is, and how experienced your opponent is at maneuvering around your tricks. Sometimes you can just jam enough copies of Druid that they can’t answer and they give you a window to combo off, or you can get them with Lunge while they tap out. Oko in the maindeck also gives you a legitimate plan B if you gain enough traction to land him safely and they don’t have Stubborn Denial. Sometimes they go low enough that you can play a big Ballista or Lunge back a Shalai or Ranger-Captain to steal the game. My suggestion for G1 would be to keep re-evaluating each turn whether you can combo off or focus on an alternate plan.</p>
<p>This matchup becomes a lot better in the postboard games. Your plan in the postboard games is to neuter their disruption with Veil of Summer and transform into an Oko control deck while looking for opportunities to combo off if given the chance. My biggest tip would be to be patient with Veil of Summer and rarely if ever tap out of the single G if possible. Expect Plague Engineer from them in the postboard games. Chameleon Colossus is another single-card plan B that can steal games if they don’t draw any Snaps.</p>
<p><strong>Jund</strong></p>
<p>Matchup: Slightly unfavored</p>
<p>+1 Chameleon Colossus<br>
+4 Veil of Summer<br>
+1 Oko, Thief of Crowns<br>
+2 Path to Exile</p>
<p>-2 Noble Hierarch<br>
-2 Once Upon a Time<br>
-2 Postmortem Lunge<br>
-2 Vizier of Remedies</p>
<p>Similar to Shadow, except with a lot more clunkier interaction and threats. However, they have one extremely good card vs you - Wrenn and Six. In addition to picking off all of your mana dorks (and any stray Viziers you may happen to play), All-In-Druid is extremely bad at pressuring planeswalkers, so if your opponent plays a Wrenn and Six on 2 then it is fairly likely to ultimate. Your goal game 1 should be to take advantage of their clunky interaction and combo off; this is easier if you have Givers or Lunge in hand. Postboard your plan is to again transform into an Oko control deck and control the battlefield with Elks, while trying to look for opportunities to combo off. Veil is a house versus them.</p>
<p><strong>4C Urza (Thopter-Sword)</strong></p>
<p>Matchup: Even/slightly unfavored</p>
<p>On the draw</p>
<p>+1 Caustic Caterpillar<br>
+2 Collector Ouphe<br>
+1 Knight of Autumn<br>
+2 Path to Exile<br>
+1 Oko, Thief of Crowns</p>
<p>-2 Birds of Paradise<br>
-2 Postmortem Lunge<br>
-1 Vizier of Remedies<br>
-2 Once Upon a Time</p>
<p>On the play</p>
<p>+1 Caustic Caterpillar<br>
+2 Collector Ouphe<br>
+1 Knight of Autumn<br>
+4 Veil of Summer</p>
<p>-2 Birds of Paradise<br>
-1 Noble Hierarch<br>
-3 Postmortem Lunge<br>
-2 Once Upon a Time<br>
-1 Oko, Thief of Crowns</p>
<p>We want to lock them out of doing anything meaningful on the draw and on the play we just want to combo them ASAP before they get Engineer/Urza online. They play a lot of blue/black interaction (Thoughtseize, Brutality, Trophy, Oko) which makes Veil of Summer appealing on the play. Think that on the draw you have to play it slow and treat it like a midrange grind fest as they are likely slowing down to bring in interaction, while on the play we just want to combo them with Veil protection as they likely are not changing how they board between games.</p>
<p>Was based on <a href="http://www.starcitygames.com/decks/133889">this list</a>, if they show you more Galvanic Blasts or Dead of Winters then keep in Lunges over Veils</p>
<p><strong>Simic Midrange Urza (Lotus Box)</strong></p>
<p>Matchup: Slightly favored</p>
<p>+4 Veil of Summer<br>
+2 Collector Ouphe<br>
+1 Oko, Thief of Crowns<br>
+1 Knight of Autumn</p>
<p>-2 Postmortem Lunge<br>
-2 Birds of Paradise<br>
-2 Giver of Runes<br>
-2 Once Upon a Time</p>
<p>Despite being an Urza deck this deck doesn’t actually run that many must-kill artifacts; every artifact in this deck is basically air or one-ofs that win the game. We do want a way to deal with the 1x Cage/Needle postboard but Oko can most likely take care of that. Veils I’d imagine are insane here because of their reliance on countermagic and black disruption. We cut some number of Givers because their main form of interaction against us generally tends to be looping Engineered Explosives.</p>
<p><strong>UW Control</strong></p>
<p>Matchup: Unfavored</p>
<p>+4 Veil of Summer<br>
+1 Oko, Thief of Crowns</p>
<p>-2 Postmortem Lunge<br>
-2 Birds of Paradise <br>
-1 Once Upon a Time</p>
<p>Against all fair decks, Oko is the name of the game. UW Control is notoriously bad at pressuring opposing planeswalkers and as such if you manage to resolve an early Oko then the game can rapidly spiral out of control in your favor, as Oko generates 3/3s every other turn and upticks to a very large amount of loyalty. I like to play this matchup aggressively and force them to have a sweeper, as this matchup is unfavored the longer the game goes. Game 1, your most important card is Ranger-Captain of Eos. If you have a Ranger-Captain in play, a Druid in your graveyard, and the combo in hand (Postmortem Lunge + Vizier + Mana Sink), then you can sac Ranger-Captain before going off to give your opponent effectively no way to interact with your combo. Oko Game 1 can also steal some games, as they effectively have zero way to get it off the table besides Teferi tuck or Detention Sphere.</p>
<p>I like shaving on Birds in SBing because they can’t pressure opposing planeswalkers while I keep in all four copies of Vizier as a Goblin Piker can sometimes pressure a walker and there are often times where your opponent can only keep up a Force of Negation as relevant interaction, which Vizier laughs at. I would also shift my SBing around depending on my opponent’s exact build - I would bring in Paths if my opponent has Spell Quellers (which ignore Veil of Summer) and I would shave on Lunges if my opponent brings in graveyard hate. I would also bring in Caterpillar or Knight of Autumn if my opponent shows me Search for Azcanta or Detention Sphere.</p>
<p>Postboard I would lean very heavily on Oko, as their deck hasn’t adapted to keep up with that planeswalker yet and it conveniently sidesteps every piece of sideboard hate they bring in versus you (Ashiok, Surgical). Again, this matchup can vary wildly in difficulty depending on your opponent’s experience level with the deck. I think you are pretty unfavored against a UW player who knows what they’re doing, though, which is why I don’t think this matchup is great.</p>
<p><strong>Dredge</strong></p>
<p>Matchup: Slightly favored</p>
<p>+1 Burrenton Forge-Tender<br>
+4 Veil of Summer</p>
<p>-3 Oko, Thief of Crowns<br>
-2 Noble Hierarch</p>
<ul>
<li>edited because you might need the black mana from Birds to cast Postmortem Lunge if you are at 2 or less life</li>
</ul>
<p>I say this matchup is slightly favored because even though our combo is naturally well-positioned versus them, their deck is extremely fast and a timely Conflagrate can ruin all of our fun. Game 1 basically comes down to “hope they don’t mill over Conflagrate” or hope that you drew your 8 copies of either Giver of Runes or Postmortem Lunge to play through that. They only run 2 copies of Conflagrate, though, and their deck has to mulligan quite low because Looting is banned.</p>
<p>Postboard you have access to the almighty Burrenton Forge-Tender which hoses Conflagrate and stops any timely Lightning Axes they may wish to cast. Veils stops the rest of their postboard interaction and are way better than the Okos you are shaving. We cut on Birds because any one toughness dork is very vulnerable to Darkblast and Conflagrate.</p>
<p><strong>Titanshift</strong></p>
<p>Matchup: Favored</p>
<p>+1 Burrenton Forge-Tender<br>
+1 Knight of Autumn<br>
+1 Caustic Caterpillar</p>
<p>-3 Oko, Thief of Crowns</p>
<p>We smash Titanshift because they are typically a full turn (sometimes two) slower than we are and they run very little interaction main and side for our combo. Their best interaction is typically Bolt maindeck and Anger postboard, which are all very weak to Giver, Lunge, and Forge-Tender. Postboard we just bring in the enchantment removal because they are better than the Okos we are shaving; I think they’re weak in general but tagging a Khalni Heart Expedition or Primastic Omen (or Needle/Cage if they have it and bring it in) seems worth it. As usual vs big mana decks, you are never winning the long game, so keep hands that kill on turn 3 with some protection if able.</p>
<p><strong>Humans</strong></p>
<p>Matchup: Even</p>
<p>On the draw:</p>
<p>+2 Path to Exile</p>
<p>-2 Oko, Thief of Crowns</p>
<p>On the play:</p>
<p>+3 Veil of Summer<br>
+2 Path to Exile</p>
<p>-1 Oko, Thief of Crowns<br>
-2 Noble Hierarch<br>
-2 Postmortem Lunge</p>
<p>Before Modern Horizons (and when this deck was still a Company deck), I would have said that we were solidly ahead in this matchup. Kitchen Finks bought a lot of time and their deck was cold to infinite life, and Meddling Mage was woefully ineffective versus us because we had so many ways to put our combo pieces directly into play. Now, with Eladamri’s Call putting our combo piece directly into our hand (plus we don’t have Finks anymore), I would say that this matchup got more difficult for us. This is the matchup where I am most unsure about sideboarding because their deck attacks on so many different angles. Veil of Summer is great versus Reflector Mage, Deputy, and Freebooter, but it sucks versus Meddling Mage and Plague Engineer. Oko is great versus Meddling Mage/Engineer/Freebooter/Deputy, but on the other hand you spent three mana to add to the total power of their board.</p>
<p>Generally the plan in this matchup is to go fast (play/draw matters a ton unfortunately) and hope they don’t lock you out before you are able to kill them. Mulligan aggressively for hands with Druid in them and in particular prioritize Giver of Runes, which is one of the strongest cards in the matchup for its ability to blank their creature interaction and be a menace in combat. An important tip is to kill your Druid in response to a Reflector Mage if you have another copy in hand or you have Lunge in hand in order to kill them next turn. The longer the game goes the easier it is for them to lock you out and put a clock on you, so kill them early.</p>
<p><strong>Eldrazi Tron</strong></p>
<p>Matchup: Even to slightly favored</p>
<p>+2 Path to Exile<br>
+1 Caustic Caterpillar<br>
+1 Knight of Autumn</p>
<p>-3 Oko, Thief of Crowns<br>
-1 Birds of Paradise</p>
<p>Not sure about this sideboarding strategy but it makes sense to me in theory. I think that Game 1 really depends on what kind of draw they have, because Chalice is embarrassing interaction versus us unless it’s on 2. I think the plan should be to go under them if possible and take advantage of the fact that they have extremely clunky hands on occasion. Thought-Knot Seer is a very difficult card to beat, though, and it is one of their best cards versus us. Postboard, Path plays versus their giant Eldrazi and we bring in a smattering of artifact removal for their Needle effects and any large Ballista. Oko seems ineffective here as turning TKS into a 3/3 that doesn’t draw you a card when it leaves the battlefield is not where you want to be. I would need more games versus E Tron to feel comfortable about this sideboarding plan.</p>
<p><strong>Storm</strong></p>
<p>Matchup: Unfavored</p>
<p>+4 Veil of Summer<br>
+1 Burrenton Forge-Tender</p>
<p>-1 Birds of Paradise<br>
-1 Vizier of Remedies<br>
-1 Once Upon a Time<br>
-2 Postmortem Lunge</p>
<p>Play/draw matters a ton in this matchup. I would say this is unfavored because we don’t have disruption nor any graveyard hate for their combo, and they bring in good interaction postboard with Repeal and Bolt. Veil is insane in this matchup to counter all of their bounce spells and Gifts Ungiven, plus it lets you cut past a Remand. Forge Tender does nothing vs Grapeshot, but it lets you play around their red removal they bring in postboard. Try and win the die roll because you have little recourse for t2 Baral/Electromancer, while they can go Repeal or ritual + Grapeshot to answer your t2 Druid.</p>
<p>Oko turning their mana dorks into Elks is a fun strategy but my gut tells me it’s a little too slow. Ranger Captain and Shalai are also strong cards in the matchup; with Ranger out your opponent cannot storm off unless they remove him, and Shalai means that they cannot target us with Gifts and they would need to bounce her with a blue bounce spell to Grapeshot us (which Veil of Summer also protects from!)</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Overall, if you are looking for a fast, consistent combo deck that has reasonable matchups against most of the top decks in the format right now, I can’t recommend All-In Druid enough. I think the deck is quite underrated at the moment and I am looking forward to tuning the deck further for the SCG Invitational.</p>
<p>If you want to read more about the deck, one of the people in the Creature Toolbox Discord community, HippityLongEars, has <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/druidleagues/home">an amazing blog</a> where he chronicles 50+ leagues of playing All-In Druid on MTGO. As far as I’m aware of this is the only blog of its kind, and the way he presents information makes it much more digestible than a stream VOD or video. Highly recommend checking it out.</p>
